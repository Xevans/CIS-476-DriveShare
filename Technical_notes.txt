Run Virtual Environment:
source .devcontainer/src/.venv/bin/activate

Run Server:
python manage.py runserver (run this command in the src directory)

Side note:
Django may need to be reinstalled.
This is because containers are stateless. Make sure it is reading requirements.txt so it can build the container w necessary dependencies

Adding dependencies:
Be sure to run the command 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' in the root folder after adding or modifying a dependency so docker can install it on build.
